                Once upon a time, in a faraway land, there lived a king and queen who were very sad because they had no children. But one day, to their great joy, the queen gave birth to a daughter, and the king held a great feast to celebrate the occasion. He invited all the fairies in the kingdom to be the godmothers of the little princess, so that each could bestow upon her a gift, as was the custom of fairies in those days.
            </p>
            <p>
                After the feast, all the fairies gathered around the cradle to give their gifts. One fairy promised that the princess would be beautiful. Another said she would be as graceful as a swan. A third gave her the gift of song, and a fourth the gift of dance. Each fairy in turn gave her a gift, and soon the princess had all the virtues one could wish for.
            </p>
            <p>
                But just as the last fairy was about to give her gift, an evil fairy who had not been invited to the feast burst into the room in a terrible rage. "Since I was not invited to this great celebration, I will give the princess a gift too!" she said. "When the princess turns sixteen, she will prick her finger on a spindle and die!"
            </p>
            <p>
                The king and queen were horrified, and the whole court began to weep. But the good fairy who had not yet given her gift stepped forward. "Do not cry," she said. "I cannot undo the wicked fairy's curse, but I can soften it. The princess will not die, but she will fall into a deep sleep that will last for a hundred years. At the end of that time, a prince will come and wake her with a kiss."
            </p>
            <p>
                The king, hoping to avoid the curse altogether, ordered that all the spinning wheels in the kingdom be destroyed. But as fate would have it, on the princess's sixteenth birthday, she came across an old woman spinning in a tower of the castle. Curious to see how the wheel worked, the princess reached out to touch it, and pricked her finger. Immediately, she fell into a deep sleep.
            </p>
            <p>
                The king and queen placed her on a bed of velvet, and the good fairy cast a spell that made everyone in the castle fall asleep, so that when the princess awoke, she would not be alone. A great forest grew up around the castle, hiding it from view, and there the princess slept, her beauty untouched by time.
            </p>
            <p>
                After a hundred years had passed, a prince who had heard the tale of the sleeping princess came to the castle. He cut his way through the thick forest and found the princess lying on her bed of velvet. Enchanted by her beauty, he bent down and kissed her. At once, the princess awoke, and with her the entire castle. The king and queen, the courtiers, and even the animals in the royal stables all awoke, and the castle buzzed with life once again.
            </p>
            <p>
                The prince and princess were married that very day, and they lived happily ever after.
